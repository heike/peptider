\title{Calculate neighborhood distribution}
\usage{
genNeighbors(sch, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{sch}{library scheme}

\item{k}{length of the peptide sequences}
}
\value{
dataset of peptide sequences: AA are amino acid sequences, 
c0 are codons for self representation, 
cr is the ratio of #neighbors in first degree neighborhood (not counting self representations) and #codons in self representation
N1 is the number of neighbors in codon representation (including self representation)
}
\description{
Calculate distribution of neighbors under library scheme lib for peptide sequences of length k.
}
\examples{
genNeighbors(scheme("NNK"), 2)
genNeighbors(scheme("2020"), 2)
