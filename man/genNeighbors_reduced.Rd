\title{Calculate neighborhood distribution}
\usage{
genNeighbors_reduced(sch, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{sch}{library scheme}

\item{k}{length of the peptide sequences}
}
\value{
dataset of peptide sequences: L are amino acid sequences,
c0 are codons for self representation,
cr is the ratio of #neighbors in first degree neighborhood (not counting self representations) and #codons in self representation
N1 is the number of neighbors in codon representation (including self representation)
s is the number of peptide sequences described by the label
o is the number of peptide sequences reached by permutations
}
\description{
Calculate distribution of neighbors under library scheme lib for peptide sequences of length k.
