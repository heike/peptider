\description{
The BLOSUM80 matrix, which stands for Blocks Substitution
Matrix, defines log-odds scores for the ratio of the chance
of two amino acids appearing in a sequence over the chance
that the two amino acids appear in any sequence.  Larger
scores indicate a higher probability of substitutions.
This matrix is used in order to compute sequences which are
in the neighborhood of other sequences.
