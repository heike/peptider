\title{Relative efficiency of a library}
\usage{
efficiency(k, libscheme, N, lib = NULL, variance = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{length of peptide sequences}

\item{libscheme}{Name (character vector) or definition (data frame) of scheme}

\item{N}{size of the library}

\item{lib}{library, if null, libscheme will be used to create it}

\item{variance}{return the variance instead of the expected value}
}
\value{
relative efficiency index between 0 and 1
}
\description{
Relative efficiency of a peptide library, defined as the ratio of expected diversity of a peptide library relative to its overall number of oligonucleotides
}
\examples{
efficiency(3, "NNN", 10^2)
efficiency(3, "NNK", 10^2)
efficiency(3, "2020", 10^2) ## 20/20 efficiency is not 1 because of random sampling.
