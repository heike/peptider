\title{Coverage as expected number of peptides given all possible peptides}
\usage{
coverage(k, libscheme, N, lib = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{length of peptide sequences}

\item{libscheme}{Name (character vector) or definition (data frame) of scheme}

\item{N}{size of the library}

\item{lib}{library scheme}
}
\value{
coverage index between 0 and 1
}
\description{
Coverage of library of size N given random sampling from the pool of all possible peptides according to probabilities determined according to the library scheme.
}
\examples{
coverage(2, "NNN", 10^3)
coverage(2, "NNK", 10^3)
coverage(2, "Trimer", 10^3) ## Trimer coverage is not 1 because of random sampling.
