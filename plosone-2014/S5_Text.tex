{\bf Validation \hh{of results based on established software sources.}}
The intersecting properties of GLUE-IT and PeLiCa offer the possibility to directly compare values for peptide diversity and coverage for the following libraries: Peptide length: 6; Encoding schemes: NNN, NNB, NNK and NNS with variable library sizes; cysteines regarded as viable. Both PeLiCa and GLUE-IT offer identical values for libraries of sizes 10 million, 100 million and 1 billion as indicated in the \nameref{tbl:div} and \nameref{tbl:cov}.
