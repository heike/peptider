Title: Evaluation of Diversity in Nucleotide Libraries

Description: Evaluation of diversity in peptide libraries, including NNN, NNB,
    NNK/S, and 20/20 schemes. Custom encoding schemes can also be defined.
    Metrics for evaluation include expected coverage, relative efficiency, and
    the functional diversity of the library. Peptide-level inclusion
    probabilities are computable for both the native and custom encoding
    schemes.
